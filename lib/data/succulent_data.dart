    description:
        "The Aloe vera plant has a short, stout stem and a rosette of fleshy, lanceolate leaves which have a serrated margin of small white teeth. The leaves may be flecked with white and are pale green or gray-green in color. Aloe vera plants produce a conspicuous inflorescence composed of densely packed pendulous yellow flowers on a spike which can be up to 90 cm (35 in) in height. The plant itself can grow to be 1 m (3 ft) in height, it  takes 4-5 years to mature and can live for up to 100 years if well cared for.",
    preferences:
        "Light: Full Sun Soil: well-drained sandy or loamy soils with pH in the range 6.5 - 7.5. A. vera prefers rich soils, but can tolerate poor, saline, or sodic soil. The best type of sandy soil for this crop is one that mimics the dirt found in the desert. It should be rocky and with low water content.",
    planting:
        "Aloe Vera can be grown from seeds, but is most easily propagated from suckers which are readily produced by the mother plant. The suckers are commonly referred to as “pups”. The pups should be cut from the main root by gently uprooting the mother plant and finding the point of attachment. The young plant should be cut from the parent using a sharp knife. Pups can be safely removed when they have several sets of leaves. The young plants should be planted in their own pot and watered deeply. Refrain from overwatering to force the growth of new roots. If multiple plants are being planted, provide them with individual pots or plant at least 60 cm (24 in) apart outdoors. When planting using seeds, aim at a spacing of 3ft by 3ft. Spacing is extremely important for high quality harvest. A typical Aloe Vera plant has 25 leaves which extend up to full length of between one foot and 2 feet. This is why experts recommend a minimum spacing of 3 feet all round.",
    care:
        "General Information: Aloe plants are generally very easy to care for but care should be taken to avoid overwatering. The plants should be watered deeply but allowed to dry out before the next watering. Check the soil prior to watering. Allow the soil to dry down to a depth of 7.5 to 10 cm (3-4 in) for older, well-established plants or 3.5-5 cm (1-2 in) for younger plants. In addition, although Aloe plants require lots of light, sitting them in full sun can be harmful and it is best to position potted Aloes in a bright window. If the plant is receiving too much sun, the leaves will begin to turn brown.",

    name: "Jade Plant",

    description:
        "Jade Plant, more correctly known as Crassula ovata, is a popular succulent, rich in symbolism, and is commonly grown as a houseplant. This plant is very low maintenance and can thrive in most indoor environments. A branched, succulent shrub, the jade plant is a popular indoor plant grown primarily for its lustrous green leaves that sprout from its thick, somewhat woody stems. This low-maintenance plant can live a long time, taking on the appearance of a miniature tree as it ages. And it's very easy to grow as long as it's not overwatered or exposed to very cold temperatures. Jade plants should be kept out of the reach of pets since they can be toxic to animals1. Jade plants can also be moderately toxic to humans when ingested and contain a sap that can cause dermatitis when touched.",
    preferences:
        "Lighting: Jade plants should receive at least 6 hours of bright light each day. Young plants should be kept in bright, indirect sunlight; large, well-established jade plants can handle more direct sunlight. Kitchens and offices with a south-facing window are typically great spots with just enough light, as are western-facing windows. Jade plants that are kept in low light can become leggy and top heavy, making them susceptible to damage if they fall over, or become unable to support their own branches! Temperature: Jade plants grow best at room temperature (65° to 75°F / 18° to 24°C), but prefer slightly cooler temperatures at night and in the winter (down to 55°F / 13°C).  Note: Jade plants are not frost tolerant, so if you keep yours outdoors during the summer, be sure to bring it inside once temperatures fall to around 50°F (10°C) in autumn. During the winter months, move jade plants away from cold windows and keep them out of drafty areas. If exposed to cold temps, jade plants may drop their leaves.",
    planting:
        "You will likely need to repot your jade plant every 2 to 3 years to keep it from outgrowing its container. To help prevent the plant from getting waterlogged, use an unglazed clay pot that will allow excess moisture to evaporate away from the roots. As the plant ages, it will likely only need to be repotted every 4 or 5 years. As your plant grows, it will become increasingly important to choose wide, heavy-bottomed pots to accommodate it. Jade plants tend to grow top-heavy and can easily tip in lighter pots. After removing your plant from its outgrown pot, clean up the roots and make sure there's no fungus and place it in the soil, spreading the roots as you backfill with soil. Wait a week and then water your jade plant lightly. Pair potted jade plants with low-growing, sun-loving succulents that also have low water requirements, like hen-and-chicks or showy sedum. When seeking companion plants for outdoor jade plants, it’s important to consider both the growing conditions and space requirements for each plant. Look for succulents that will also thrive in well-drained, gritty soil and full sun.",
    care:
        "Watering: Watering jade plants correctly is very important! Improper watering is the number one issue that most people experience with their jade plants.In the spring and summer, when the plant is actively growing, it will require more water than at other times of the year. Water jade plants deeply (meaning that the soil gets sufficiently moistened throughout—not just at the surface) then wait until the soil has mostly dried out before you water it again. This means that you could end up watering it once a week or once a month—it depends entirely on how quickly the soil dries out in the environment where you keep your plant. In the fall and winter, the plant may go dormant, causing it to slow or pause growth entirely. During this time, it won’t need much water. Water it less often than in the spring and summer, allowing the soil to dry out fully between waterings. Large, well-established jades may not need more than one or two waterings throughout their entire dormancy period. Try to avoid splashing water on the leaves while watering, as this can expose them to rot in a humid environment. Jade plants can be sensitive to salts in tap water, so water with filtered or distilled water if your tap water is not ideal. If the plant starts to drop its leaves, if the leaves look shriveled, or if brown spots appear on the leaves, it indicates that the plant needs MORE water. If leaves become squishy and waterlogged, the plant is getting TOO MUCH water.",

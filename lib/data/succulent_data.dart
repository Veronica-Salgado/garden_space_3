    description:
        "The Aloe vera plant has a short, stout stem and a rosette of fleshy, lanceolate leaves which have a serrated margin of small white teeth. The leaves may be flecked with white and are pale green or gray-green in color. Aloe vera plants produce a conspicuous inflorescence composed of densely packed pendulous yellow flowers on a spike which can be up to 90 cm (35 in) in height. The plant itself can grow to be 1 m (3 ft) in height, it  takes 4-5 years to mature and can live for up to 100 years if well cared for.",
    preferences:
        "Light: Full Sun Soil: well-drained sandy or loamy soils with pH in the range 6.5 - 7.5. A. vera prefers rich soils, but can tolerate poor, saline, or sodic soil. The best type of sandy soil for this crop is one that mimics the dirt found in the desert. It should be rocky and with low water content.",
    planting:
        "Aloe Vera can be grown from seeds, but is most easily propagated from suckers which are readily produced by the mother plant. The suckers are commonly referred to as “pups”. The pups should be cut from the main root by gently uprooting the mother plant and finding the point of attachment. The young plant should be cut from the parent using a sharp knife. Pups can be safely removed when they have several sets of leaves. The young plants should be planted in their own pot and watered deeply. Refrain from overwatering to force the growth of new roots. If multiple plants are being planted, provide them with individual pots or plant at least 60 cm (24 in) apart outdoors. When planting using seeds, aim at a spacing of 3ft by 3ft. Spacing is extremely important for high quality harvest. A typical Aloe Vera plant has 25 leaves which extend up to full length of between one foot and 2 feet. This is why experts recommend a minimum spacing of 3 feet all round.",
    care:
        "General Information: Aloe plants are generally very easy to care for but care should be taken to avoid overwatering. The plants should be watered deeply but allowed to dry out before the next watering. Check the soil prior to watering. Allow the soil to dry down to a depth of 7.5 to 10 cm (3-4 in) for older, well-established plants or 3.5-5 cm (1-2 in) for younger plants. In addition, although Aloe plants require lots of light, sitting them in full sun can be harmful and it is best to position potted Aloes in a bright window. If the plant is receiving too much sun, the leaves will begin to turn brown.",
